# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 04, 2023

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**:

- Went through the Odin Project, learnt about packets, DNS and set up WSL environment for development.
- Worked on my Movie Watchlist App using OMDB API: stored the IMDB IDs returned using async functions in a variable.

**Thoughts:**

- The Odin Project

  - Fixing WSL took some time, had to set the DNS in the environment to Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS to get it connected to the Internet.
  - Learning how the internet and the Web works on the background was pretty interesting.
  - I have started learning command line basics from https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/.

- Scrimba Frontend path
  - I have been working on the Movie Watchlist App as part of the Scrimba Frontend Path.
  - I have used an async function to store MovieIDs in a variable.
  - I will need to create another function (async probably) to make use of the IDS to get more details and render on the page.
  - Async is a struggle as of now, definitely need more practice.
  - I have only designed the app for mobile, will need to work on CSS later.

**Today's Progress**:

- Worked on my Movie Watchlist, added functionality to render the movie details returned from a search.

**Thoughts:**

- use forEach to loop over the data and render it, my grasp on async is getting better. Must make the code DRYer tho.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
